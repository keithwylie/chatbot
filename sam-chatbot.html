                answer: "Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down glucose to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's energy currency. It consists of three main stages:\n\n1. Glycolysis (cytoplasm): One glucose molecule is broken down into two pyruvate molecules, producing a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH.\n\n2. Krebs cycle/Citric acid cycle (mitochondrial matrix): Pyruvate is further broken down, releasing CO₂ and producing 2 ATP, 6 NADH, and 2 FADH₂ per glucose.\n\n3. Electron transport chain (inner mitochondrial membrane): NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons, creating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. This produces approximately 32-34 ATP.\n\nTotal yield: ~36-38 ATP per glucose molecule in aerobic conditions. The overall equation is essentially the reverse of photosynthesis."

                answer: "Mitosis is a type of cell division that produces two genetically identical daughter cells from a single parent cell. It's essential for growth, tissue repair, and asexual reproduction. The process consists of several phases:\n\n1. Prophase: Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes (each consisting of two sister chromatids), and the nuclear envelope breaks down. The mitotic spindle begins to form.\n\n2. Metaphase: Chromosomes align at the cell's equator (metaphase plate), attached to spindle fibers at their centromeres.\n\n3. Anaphase: Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.\n\n4. Telophase: Nuclear envelopes reform around each set of chromosomes, which begin to decondense.\n\n5. Cytokinesis: The cytoplasm divides, producing two separate cells.\n\nEach daughter cell receives an identical copy of the parent cell's DNA, maintaining the same chromosome number."

                answer: "DNA replication is the process by which a cell copies its DNA before cell division, ensuring each daughter cell receives a complete set of genetic information. It follows a semiconservative model, where each new DNA molecule consists of one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.\n\nKey steps:\n\n1. Initiation: Helicase unwinds the double helix at origins of replication, creating a replication fork.\n\n2. Elongation:\n   - Leading strand: DNA polymerase synthesizes continuously in the 5' to 3' direction\n   - Lagging strand: Synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments, also in the 5' to 3' direction\n   - Primase creates RNA primers to initiate synthesis\n   - DNA ligase joins Okazaki fragments together\n\n3. Termination: Replication continues until the entire molecule is copied.\n\nProofreading mechanisms ensure high accuracy, with error rates of about 1 in 10 billion nucleotides."

                answer: "Natural selection is the primary mechanism of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin. It explains how populations change over time through differential survival and reproduction. The process requires four conditions:\n\n1. Variation: Individuals in a population have different traits (phenotypes).\n\n2. Heritability: These traits are at least partially heritable and can be passed to offspring.\n\n3. Differential reproduction: Some variants are better suited to their environment and have higher survival and reproductive success (fitness).\n\n4. Accumulation: Over generations, advantageous traits become more common in the population.\n\nExample: In a population of beetles, some are green and some are brown. If birds preferentially prey on green beetles because they're easier to spot, brown beetles will have higher survival rates. Over time, the brown trait becomes more prevalent in the population.\n\nNatural selection doesn't produce 'perfect' organisms—it only favors traits that confer reproductive advantages in a specific environment."

                answer: "A gene is a fundamental unit of heredity—a specific sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a functional product, typically a protein or RNA molecule. Genes are segments of DNA located on chromosomes.\n\nKey characteristics:\n\n1. Structure: A gene includes not only the coding sequence (exons) but also regulatory regions (promoters, enhancers) and non-coding sequences (introns in eukaryotes).\n\n2. Function: Through transcription and translation, genes direct protein synthesis, which determines traits and cellular functions.\n\n3. Alleles: Different versions of the same gene are called alleles. For example, a gene for eye color might have a brown allele and a blue allele.\n\n4. Expression: Not all genes are active all the time. Gene expression is regulated based on cell type, developmental stage, and environmental signals.\n\nThe human genome contains approximately 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes, though only about 1.5% of our DNA actually codes for proteins. The relationship between genotype (genetic makeup) and phenotype (observable traits) is complex and influenced by gene interactions and environment."

Transcription (in the nucleus):\n   - RNA polymerase binds to a gene's promoter region\n   - The DNA double helix unwinds\n   - RNA polymerase synthesizes a complementary mRNA strand using the DNA template\n   - In eukaryotes, the pre-mRNA is processed (5' cap, 3' poly-A tail, splicing to remove introns)\n   - Mature mRNA exits the nucleus\n\n2. Translation (on ribosomes in the cytoplasm):\n   - Initiation: The ribosome binds to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG)\n   - Elongation: tRNA molecules bring amino acids corresponding to each mRNA codon. The ribosome catalyzes peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids\n   - Termination: When a stop codon is reached, the completed polypeptide chain is released\n\nThe genetic code is read in triplets (codons), with each three-nucleotide sequence specifying one amino acid. The resulting polypeptide then folds into its functional three-dimensional structure."

                answer: "Homeostasis is the process by which organisms maintain stable internal conditions despite changes in the external environment. It's essential for survival, as most biological processes require specific conditions to function properly.\n\nKey aspects regulated:\n- Body temperature\n- Blood pH\n- Blood glucose levels\n- Water and electrolyte balance\n- Blood pressure\n\nMechanism: Most homeostatic processes use negative feedback loops:\n1. A sensor detects a change from the set point\n2. A control center processes this information\n3. An effector produces a response that counteracts the original change\n\nExample - Temperature regulation:\n- If body temperature rises: Sensors in the skin and hypothalamus detect the change. The hypothalamus triggers responses like sweating and vasodilation (blood vessels near skin surface dilate), which cool the body.\n- If body temperature falls: The hypothalamus triggers shivering and vasoconstriction, generating and conserving heat.\n\nPositive feedback loops (like blood clotting or childbirth) are less common and amplify rather than counteract changes."

                answer: "Enzymes are biological catalysts—proteins that speed up chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. They're essential for nearly all metabolic processes in cells.\n\nHow enzymes work:\n\n1. Active site: Each enzyme has a specific three-dimensional active site where substrate molecules bind.\n\n2. Induced fit model: When a substrate binds, the enzyme undergoes a slight conformational change that positions catalytic residues optimally, lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction.\n\n3. Product formation: The enzyme facilitates bond breaking/forming, then releases products and returns to its original state, ready to catalyze another reaction.\n\nKey properties:\n- Specificity: Each enzyme typically catalyzes only one type of reaction\n- Efficiency: Can increase reaction rates by factors of millions\n- Regulation: Activity can be modulated by inhibitors, activators, pH, and temperature\n\nFactors affecting enzyme activity:\n- Temperature: Activity increases with temperature until denaturation occurs\n- pH: Each enzyme has an optimal pH; extreme values cause denaturation\n- Substrate concentration: Reaction rate increases until all enzyme active sites are saturated\n- Inhibitors: Competitive (compete with substrate for active site) or non-competitive (bind elsewhere, changing enzyme shape)"

Non-random mating: Patterns like inbreeding or sexual selection\n\nEvidence for evolution:\n- Fossil record showing transitional forms\n- Comparative anatomy (homologous structures)\n- Molecular biology (DNA/protein sequence similarities)\n- Biogeography (species distribution patterns)\n- Direct observation (antibiotic resistance, selective breeding)\n\nMicroevolution refers to small-scale changes within populations (like antibiotic resistance), while macroevolution involves larger-scale changes leading to new species over long time periods.\n\nImportant note: Evolution has no direction or goal—it's not progress toward 'better' organisms, but simply adaptation to current environmental conditions."
